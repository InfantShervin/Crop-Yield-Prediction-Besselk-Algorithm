This project successfully demonstrates an effective approach for predicting crop yields by integrating multiple datasets, including crop characteristics, weather, and precipitation data. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques such as Gaussian Process Regression with the BESSELK (Matérn) kernel combined with ensemble models like Random Forest and XGBoost, it achieves robust and accurate yield predictions.

The hybrid spatial feature modeling framework and rigorous feature engineering significantly enhance the model’s predictive power, while cross-validation ensures reliability and generalization. Interactive geospatial visualizations provide valuable insights for understanding the spatial variability of yields.

This research contributes to the smart farming paradigm by offering tools that enable data-driven decision making to optimize agricultural practices, enhance productivity, and support sustainable resource management. Future work may extend this approach by incorporating real-time sensor data and exploring deeper neural architectures.

Acknowledging the importance of quality datasets, this project builds upon publicly available agricultural and climatic data sources, highlighting the value of open data in advancing precision agriculture research.
