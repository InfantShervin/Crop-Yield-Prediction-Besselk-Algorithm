# Crop-Yield-Prediction-Besselk-Algorithm
Hybrid ML solution for crop yield prediction using multi-source datasets, advanced spatial feature modeling, and the BESSELK (Matérn) algorithm. Integrates Gaussian process, ensemble models, and visualizations for robust, reproducible smart farming research.

## Overview
This project implements a hybrid spatial feature modeling approach for crop yield prediction using Gaussian Process Regression with the Matérn (BESSELK) kernel, combined with ensemble learning methods like Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks. It integrates multiple datasets including crop characteristics, weather data, and precipitation for robust prediction.

## Features
- Multi-source dataset integration and preprocessing
- Advanced feature engineering for spatial and temporal data
- Ensemble models with cross-validation and overfitting control
- Interactive geospatial visualization of predicted yields
- Modular and reproducible codebase with Jupyter notebooks and scripts
